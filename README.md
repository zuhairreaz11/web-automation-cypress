# Cypress Test Automation - Setup Guide

This repository provides a basic setup for using Cypress for end-to-end testing. Follow the steps below to clone the repo, set up your environment, and start testing with Cypress.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that the following are installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (to clone the repository)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-cypress-project.git
cd my-cypress-project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Once inside your project folder, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Open Cypress
Once inside your project folder, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

### 4. Create or Modify Tests
To create new tests, add them to the cypress/integration folder. Here's an example of a simple test you can create:

```bash
npx cypress open
```
### 5. Running Tests in Headless Mode (Optional)
If you'd like to run tests without the Cypress Test Runner GUI (headlessly), you can use the following command:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

### 6. Configuration
You can configure Cypress settings by modifying the cypress.json file. For example, you can set the base URL for your application, viewport size, timeouts, and more.

Example cypress.json file:

```bash
{
  "baseUrl": "https://www.example.com",
  "viewportWidth": 1280,
  "viewportHeight": 720
}
```

### 7. Troubleshooting
You can configure Cypress settings by modifying the cypress.json file. For example, you can set the base URL for your application, viewport size, timeouts, and more.

1. Delete node_modules and reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```
2. Ensure you are using a compatible version of Node.js (Cypress supports Node.js 16.x or later).

3. Refer to Cypress documentation for detailed troubleshooting: Cypress Troubleshooting Guide.
